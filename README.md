# Food_Wastage_Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing food wastage during events using a dataset that tracks food quantity, consumption, and wastage across multiple events. The aim was to identify patterns and factors contributing to food wastage and provide actionable insights to optimize food management in future events.

## Key Objectives:
- Data Organization: Used Excel to clean and organize the data, ensuring it was ready for analysis.
- Wastage Analysis: Calculated total food wastage, identifying the causes and the events with the highest wastage.
- Visualization: Created charts and graphs in Excel to visually represent the food wastage trends and patterns over time.
- Dashboard Creation: Developed an interactive dashboard in Excel that offers insights into food consumption vs wastage, helping event organizers optimize food quantities.
- Actionable Insights: Generated recommendations for reducing food wastage based on the analysis, offering strategies for better event planning.

## Key Insights:
- High Wastage Events: Certain types of events, such as large conferences and parties, showed the highest levels of food wastage. These events had more significant gaps between food prepared and food consumed.
- Food Type Impact: Perishable foods had higher wastage rates, especially when not consumed within the event's time frame.
- Event Duration: Longer events tended to have more wastage, possibly due to overestimations of guest consumption.
- Guest Count vs Wastage: Events with a fluctuating guest count (unexpected number of attendees) showed higher wastage rates, indicating the need for better prediction models.
- Catering Size: Events with more customized catering services (like buffet-style) had a higher tendency for wastage compared to fixed meals.

## Tools Used:
- Excel: For data organization, calculations, visualizations, and dashboard creation.

By identifying key areas of food wastage, this project aims to improve future event management strategies and reduce unnecessary food waste.
